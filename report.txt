What is the Perplexity of ##abaab#

0.2 * 0.7 * 0.6 * 0.25 * 0.5 * 0.1 = 0.00105  P(##abaab#)
2^(-1/8 * log2(0.00105)) = 2.35695525


This is probably an add-alpha model, many of the probabilities are exactly the same, which is probably the raw
smoothing alpha, and that every possible trigram is accounted.
